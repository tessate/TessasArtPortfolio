	Hello, welcome to my art page!
	<br/><br/><br/>
	<b><font color="EA4573"> About the artist </font></b>
	<br/>
	My name is Tessa Easterling, I am a second year Art Practice major at Saint Mary's College of California. I have always had a passion for creating ever since I was a little girl. Creating always puts me back in my happy place, no matter what I am making. I am from Sacramento, California and I love my two dogs, Coco and Pearl. I have played six sports throughout my life so far and my favorite ones are tennis and lacrosse. I love traveling and just exploring new places, my favorite adventure is probably going to Greece last summer.

<br/>
An acrylic painting on jeans of flames burning through the pants to show the bones underneath. There was no objective to this painting, except that I wanted to create a fun pair of Halloween jeans to wear to spirit day. I was inspired by Pinterest by combining flames from one painting and bones from another.

<br/>
A colored pencil close up drawing of a leaf with dew drops on it. The objective of this piece for my class was to create a gridded colored pencil drawing using less than seven colors. This piece was inspired by a picture of spring flowers in my front yard, where I focused on the wet leaf aspect. This 16”x20” colored pencil drawing was hung up in the school display case for our freshman class.

	An acrylic painting of two koi fish swimming in a pond. The objective of this piece for my class was to create a work that displayed beauty. This piece was inspired by a picture I took on my vacation to Maui. This painting was displayed in my school’s art show during a virtual show due to Covid.
